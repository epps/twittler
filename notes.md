# Twittler: MS Pre-course Project

## Basic Requirements:
- [ ] 1 .Display tweets (you can decide on how to do this, eg w/ a button, etc.)
- [ ] 2. Display timestamps
- [ ] 3. Design UI so that it's aesthetically attractive and something you'd use 
- [ ] 4. Allow users to click on a username to see that user's timeline


### Notes from 05/29/2015 - Day One
After looking through data_generator.js to get a fix on the data structures and how tweets are added to the stream, I turned my attention to the JS block in index.html. Almost immediately, I realized that I didn't really understand how the while loop worked. 

First, the variable `index`, which holds `streams.home.length - 1`:

`streams.home.length` is an always growing value thanks to `scheduleNextTweet` which randomly calls `generateRandomTweet()`. Initially, there will be at least 10 tweets generated by a for loop. Then new tweets will be generated at random intervals. 

What I can figure out is:
+ Why aren't there ever more than 11 tweets in the initial batch?
+ Why doesn't this list continue to grow? If `index`'s value is always growing and the while loop runs so long as `index >= 0`, why doesn't this continually add tweets to the body?

#### NOTE
I deleted `- 1` from `streams.home.length - 1` expecting to see the number of tweets in the list change; instead I broke the code and received this error message: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined`. 

---
#### ANSWERS:
It dawned on me (embarrassingly) that I was overly fixated on the while loop and hadn't stopped to consider that the variable assigment locks the initial value of `index` in place at 10, which happens to be the number of tweets generated by the for loop in data_generator.js. A simple `console.log(index)` before and after the while loop confirmed this. The line of code that changes `index`'s value is the decrementer at the end of the while loop, which breaks once `index` reaches -1.

This also explains why removing `- 1` broke the code and resulted in a TypeError: at the time the document ready event fires, there are only 10 tweets, even though the 11th one follows nearly immediately after this.

## 2. Display timestamps
An aesthetically unpleasing and rough solution to this requirement is simple adding to the string concatenation found in the starting source code:
- Before: `$tweet.text('@' + tweet.user + ': ' + tweet.message);`
- After: `$tweet.text('@' + tweet.user + ': ' + tweet.message + ' ' + tweet.created_at);`

Formatting the date will require either a library (check out [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) or [this list of date libraries](http://codegeekz.com/6-javascript-date-libraries-for-developers/)) or some custom JS code (check out [this sitepoint article on dates](http://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-to-javascript-date-and-time/))

## 1. Display tweets
My first thought for how to display tweets was a button that would the next tweet in the `streams.home` array. 

To do this, I'll need to:
1. Create a button and add an event listener
2. Write an event handler function that will fetch the next five tweets from `streams.home`

Where I'm at now: I've created a button and built an even handler that fetches the next tweet from the `streams.home` array, but instead of adding  it to the list, lengthing the list of tweets by one element, it __replaces__ the first element in the list. I expected the function to add `<div>` after `<div>` to the list, and since I can't identify a part of the code that's capping the displayed tweets at 11, I'm stuck for the moment. One solution is to avoid the issue altogether by writing some HTML, into which I could inject the tweets (e.g. a container element that I could style down the line).

### Notes from 05/30/2015 - Day Two
I've tried several changes (e.g. creating a container for the tweets) but I'm still running into the same behavior: the on click function replaces the first element in the list of tweets instead of adding to the list. I've also noticed that the last item in the list (chronologically speaking, the first tweet generated by the `generateRandomTweet()`) gets pushed out of the list. Here's a [screenshot of the behavior](http://cl.ly/image/1x0T1b313G17).

Here's the button code:
    $('button').on('click', function() {
      nextTweet = streams.home[tweetCounter];
      $tweet.text('@' + nextTweet.user + ': ' + nextTweet.message);
      $('.tweet').first().before($tweet);
      tweetCounter++;
    });

I've gone ahead and worked around this problem; however, I'm bookmarking it for later since I think solving it will either point out some painfully obvious thing I've been overlooking or teach me something new about jQuery.
