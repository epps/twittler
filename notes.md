# Twittler: MS Pre-course Project

## Basic Requirements:
- [ ] 1 .Display tweets (you can decide on how to do this, eg w/ a button, etc.)
- [ ] 2. Display timestamps
- [ ] 3. Design UI so that it's aesthetically attractive and something you'd use 
- [ ] 4. Allow users to click on a username to see that user's timeline


### Notes from 05/29/2015 - Day One
After looking through data_generator.js to get a fix on the data structures and how tweets are added to the stream, I turned my attention to the JS block in index.html. Almost immediately, I realized that I didn't really understand how the while loop worked. 

First, the variable `index`, which holds `streams.home.length - 1`:

`streams.home.length` is an always growing value thanks to `scheduleNextTweet` which randomly calls `generateRandomTweet()`. Initially, there will be at least 10 tweets generated by a for loop. Then new tweets will be generated at random intervals. 

What I can figure out is:
+ Why aren't there ever more than 11 tweets in the initial batch?
+ Why doesn't this list continue to grow? If `index`'s value is always growing and the while loop runs so long as `index >= 0`, why doesn't this continually add tweets to the body?

#### NOTE
I deleted `- 1` from `streams.home.length - 1` expecting to see the number of tweets in the list change; instead I broke the code and received this error message: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined`. 

---
It dawned on me (embarrassingly) that I was overly fixated on the while loop and hadn't stopped to consider that the variable assigment locks the initial value of `index` in place at 10, which happens to be the number of tweets generated by the for loop in data_generator.js. A simple `console.log(index)` before and after the while loop confirmed this. The line of code that changes `index`'s value is the decrementer at the end of the while loop, which breaks once `index` reaches -1.

This also explains why removing `- 1` broke the code and resulted in a TypeError: at the time the document ready event fires, there are only 10 tweets, even though the 11th one follows nearly immediately after this. 

---

## 2. Display timestamps
An aesthetically unpleasing and rough solution to this requirement is simple adding to the string concatenation found in the starting source code:
- Before: `$tweet.text('@' + tweet.user + ': ' + tweet.message);`
- After: `$tweet.text('@' + tweet.user + ': ' + tweet.message + ' ' + tweet.created_at);`

Formatting the date will require either a library (check out [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) or [this list of date libraries](http://codegeekz.com/6-javascript-date-libraries-for-developers/)) or some custom JS code (check out [this sitepoint article on dates](http://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-to-javascript-date-and-time/))
